# Adventure_Game

This is my CS 361 Software Engineering I class project "Adventure Game". It is a turn-based RPG game that will go through levels where the adventurer will have to battle monsters. to get to the last level. The controls are the following:

ENTER: confirm your selection

BACK: to return to prior selection

UP: moves cursor up 

DOWN: moves cursor down 

I have recently created a video showcasing my project as well at its capabilities found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqFF9k55ugI

Thank you for playing :-)
